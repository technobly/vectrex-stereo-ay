Ordering PCB's
===

OSHPark is a good place to order with purple or the new "after dark" theme color scheme.  You can upload the KiCad `vextrex-eprom-dumper.kicad_pcb` there directly.  I would download this entire Github repo ZIP file first though instead of just trying to save the PCB file from your browser.

Another way to order PCB's is by using the included [gerbers-tall-design](gerbers/vectrex-stereo-ay-v1.0.zip) and uploading those with all of the necessary specs to companies like [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com) or [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com)
